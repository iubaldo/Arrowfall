premise: smash-like party game centered around scaling a tower while shooting foes with arrows
	inspired by: smash, towerfall ascension

elevator pitch: 
Arrowfall is a archery-based, smash-like party game where you shoot other players with arrows while trying to ascend a tower.
Similar to smash, being hit by arrows increases the amount of knockback you take, with being shot off the screen resulting in death. There are two main 
gamemodes planned, race and survival. Race is a split-screen gamemode with a finite map size with the first player to reach the top of the tower wins. 
In the Survival gamemode, the screen will continually pan upwards, and falling off the bottom of the screen will result in losing a stock.
Alongside normal arrows, players will be able to acquire a variety of different arrow types and defensive items for use during the game.
Finally, upon death, players will still be able to participate via control of a wall-mounted crossbow turret on the sides of the screen.
If a dead player manages to kill a living player, they will be able to steal one of their stocks and resurrect back into the match.

2 main gamemodes:
	race: finite map size, first to reach the top wins
		each player has their own screen, falling off the bottom of the screen does not result in a death
		more obstacles spawn in this gamemodes
	survival: infinite amount of platforms, last player standing wins
		players must scale up the tower as the screen continually moves upwards
			tower is procedurally generated
		falling off the edge of the screen results in death
main mechanics:
	players have access to a bow and an infinite amount of normal arrows
		arrows are affected by gravity
		arrow damage scales with velocity
		holding down the attack button charges up a shot, increasing arrow velocity and power, but slows down the player
			this also slows down fall speed, but to a lesser extent than other directions of movement, 
			allowing for mid-air shots to be more effective
	players also have access to a double jump and wallslide/jump
	taking damage increases a player's knockback, similar to smash
	falling outside a "blast zone" outside the visible screen (again, like smash) results in death for the player
		lives work on a stock system, with each death reducing that player's stocks until they run out
	each player has access to a directional shield, controlled similarly to their bow
		similar to the shield in stick fight, shield size decreases the longer it's held out
		shield effectiveness regenerates over time when not in use
	items (including special arrow types) spawn randomly during a game, allowing players to augment their attacks or activate special effects
		special arrows replace normal arrows for a limited amount of attacks once used
		only one item may be held at once
			pressing the item command when an item is nearby picks it up
				trying to pick up an item while you already have one swaps it out
			holding the item command while you have an item drops it
items:
	offensive items:
		grapple arrow: pulls user towards the arrow once it travels a certain distance or impacts with terrain/another player
			1 use
		shockwave arrow: detonates on impact, knocking away nearby players
			3 uses
		split arrow: fires weaker 5 arrows at once in a cone
			5 uses
		gravity arrow: detonates on impact, attracting nearby players to the point of impact for short time
			3 use
		shattershot arrow: fires a massive beam that passes through terrain at the cost of greatly increasing the user's own knockback percent
			visually similar to a sans gaster blaster, slight fire delay with hitbox warning
			1 use
		featherweight arrow: faster arrow that fires perfectly straight with no projectile drop
			7 uses
		delay arrow: arrow stays in place after firing for 2 seconds, then accelerates
			5 uses
		heavy arrow: slower arrow with greatly increased projectile drop, but deals greatly increased damage
			5 uses
		recoil arrow: greatly increases recoil player receives when fired
			3 uses
		homing arrow: has a mild homing property once launched
			3 uses
		linked arrows: fires two arrows at opposite angles that gravitate towards one another while in flight
			7 use
	defensive/utility items:
		NOTE: all defensive items are single-use
		personal jump pad: places a slow-falling jump pad directly below the player
			see: sonic up-b from smash
		bubble shield: omnidirectional shield that blocks all arrows while active
		hi-jump: jump height is increased while active
		iron boots: greatly decrease knockback, but also increase fall speed while active
			
environment:
	platforms/terrain:
		solid: cannot be passed through
		one-way: can only be passed through from underneath
		unstable: begins to fall 1 second after being stood on by a player
		moving platforms: self-explanitory
			would need player to inherit platform momentum
	obstacles:
		jump pad: launches player when stepped on
			can be oriented in any direction
		acceleration rune: increases velocity of arrows/players that pass through it
		glue puddle: decreases jump height when standing on it
		ice: decreases horizontal acceleration/decceleration
		portals: linked portals teleport players/projectiles to their twin
		

things to think about:
	procedural level design
	graphics
		sprite-based
			harder to make dynamic
			need someone who can make pixel art
		3D
			need to know how to implement dynamic animations on a character model
		should player model even reflect the direction of aiming?
			alternative: simply have an indication line in the direction of aiming and keep player model simple
	making sure jump/movement physics "feel good"
	arrow physics
		should arrows stick into terrain? bounce off?
			arrows stick into terrain
	teaching players what each item/obstacle does intuitively
		visual cues
			held arrows/items reflected in character model
				quiver
	local vs online
		local is easier, but restrictive
		don't know how to do online features, would need to take time to learn
			would probably need to develop with online in mind from the beginning


other potential ideas:
	additional mechanics:
		have special arrows affect bow draw speed
		players who have run out of stocks are given control of a wall-mounted crossbow turret along the sides of the screen
			players can move up and down along the sides of the screen, as well as switch sides
			the turret has a limited ammo pool, but recovers slowly over time
			defeating a living player results in "stealing" their stock and resurrecting with one stock
				note that the "dead" player only needs to remove a stock, not fully defeat a "living" player in order to be revived
		blocking/deflecting an arrow depletes shields scaling with how much damage it would've done
	more standard movement abilities
		airdash
		crouch
			also reduces hurtbox
		dodge
			something in the vein of the elenai dodge mod for minecraft, might be used in midair too
	character classes with special abilities
		time consuming - need to balance, gather artwork, etc
		class ideas:
			short-ranged dash with i-frames
			wall climb
			more inventory space
			switch to rapid-fire shots that deal less knockback 
			has a gun with no projectile drop, but needs to perform a perfect reload
				see: eltnum from unist
			sword that can parry/break projectiles with a short cooldown
			can place runes that accelerate all projectiles that pass through
				see: ky from guilty gear
				alternatively, runes reflect arrows that collide with it instead		
	more gamemodes
		duel: tower is replaced with set of floating platforms, more like a traditional smash game
		arena: co-op gamemode where players face off against a boss
			also time-consuming
	more level mechanics
		buttons/switches: shoot with an arrow to active some sort of effect
			note: buttons should clearly show what they're linked to
			ex. button linked to explosives on a different (but linked) platform
			ex. button linked to destroy a linked platform
	have the tower be like a 3D cylinder, with players scaling the outside and able to move freely around in a circle
		would need clever engineering of movement physics, unrealistic tbh
