bow + mouse tracking - DONE
camera follow
controller support - DONE
menu for switching controls
	eventually for each player
support for multiple players (max 4 players) - DONE
	unique controls for each player - DONE
	only one keyboard available - DONE?
jump forgiveness - DONE
coyote time - DONE


systems:

walking - DONE
jump/double jump - DONE
shoot arrow - DONE
arrow physics - DONE
	fix arrow stuck in place bug - DONE
	fix arrow jitter on spawn bug - DONE
proper fsm + move all movement code to seperate methods - DONE
	idle - DONE
	walking - DONE

	falling - DONE 
	wall slide - DONE
	tumble
	dead
	restrict certain actions during certain states
	move wallsidecdtimer to state transitions - DONE
wall jump - DONE
variable jump heights
	jump higher the longer button is held
	short button press results in min height short hop
knockback on hit
	knockback/damage scales with arrow velocity 
	scale variable 0-1 that controls how much influence the player's inputs have
		set scale to 0 after being hit and slowly ramp it back up based on knockback amount
arrow recoil
	recoil scales with shootPower - DONE, but might remove if annoying

	proper collision detection - DONE
	deflect arrows in direction user is looking - DONE
		arrow retains speed scaling with time shield held out - DONE
		slightly randomize deflection offset angle scaling with time shield held out
		NOTE: how to balance arrow deflection with shield size? perfect deflection is way too easy rn
	slow horizontal speed while shield is held out
	change arrow/shield detection to work off of layers/groups instead of names
